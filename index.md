### Our Services

In this post, I want to introduce the idea of income share agreements and define their basic features.

Fundamental to the idea of an income share agreement (ISAs) is that the amount of money you owe should be based on the amount of income you earn. In this way, ISAs differ from loans because they do not have a traditional interest rate. Instead, when a student receives funds as part of an ISA, they agree to repay the provider based on a percentage of their future income. 

Interest in ISAs has grown [immensely](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=income%20share%20agreements) in the last five years. Purdue University launched the [Back a Boiler](https://purdue.edu/backaboiler/) program in 2016 to provide ISAs to students as an alternative to private and Parent PLUS student loans. [Lambda School](http://lambdaschool.com), a coding school launched in 2016, eschews an up-front tuition in favor of ISAs. 

For the purpose of this post, I will refer to the receiver of the initial disbursement of funds as the "student," but that is not to suggest that the only use of income share agreements is for education funding. I will refer to the provider of the initial funds, and recipient of future income share payments, as the "investor". 

### How much does it cost?

Income share agreements typically include the following elements: the funding amount, the payback rate, the income floor, the payment cap, and the term length.

#### Funding Amount

This is the amount of funds provided by the investor to the student at the creation of the ISA. The funds could be used for anything that might increase your future income: tuition payments, a living stipend, or a project. The funding amount is different than the principal in a traditional loan. In a traditional loan, the borrower must payback the lender the principal plus interest. In an ISA, there is no obligation to payback the initial funding amount.

Some ISAs will not include a funding amount. Instead, the investor provides services to the student and expects to be repaid in the future based on the students future income. At [Sharpest Minds](https://www.sharpestminds.com/)  mentors are connected with "students" and help them start a career in data science. The mentors are then paid back through an ISA.

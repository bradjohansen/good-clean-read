### Our Services

All of our students receive dedicated, one-on-one assistance, from one of our talented career coaches. Our coaches will work with students to understand their career goals, map their strengths and weaknesses to potential jobs, and get them the best job that sets them up for success.

#### Resume Writing

Don't just list your accomplishments. We will help you create a resume that stands out from the competition.

#### Career Advice and Research

Still not sure where you fit? Our team will help you discover your strengths and advise you on what industries and careers give you the life you want.

#### Job Discovery

Don't have time to sift through Linkedin, Indeed, your college career site and the thousands of other job sites? We will send you a curated list of jobs you qualify for and fit your goals.

#### Job Applications

Job applications can be stressful and every company has a different process. We can help you navigate the job application process.

#### Interview Prep

During the application process, our team will organize mock interviews to review standard interview questions and help you highlight your strengths. 

Additionally, our team will meet with you one-on-one before every interview to ensure you are ready to hit it out of the park and get that job offer.

#### Job Offer Review

You did it. You got the job offer. But what is a 401(k)? And how do I compare offers that are in different cities? Our team will help you evaluate your options so that you understand what job offer is the best one for you given your career goals.

#### Negotiations

It's the perfect job offer, except it doesn't pay enough? We will coach you through the negotiation process and make sure you are paid what you are worth.

### How much does it cost?

**Nothing** up front. When you hire us as a career coach we will work for free until you get a job. Let me say that again. We do not get paid for anything until you get a job. Instead, you agree to share with us at least **2%** of your gross income for 12 months.

With a 2% income share rate and a starting salary of $50,000 you would pay a total of $1,000 or $83.33 per month.

If you earn a starting salary of $100,000 you would pay $2,000 or $166.67 per month.

The more you make, the more we make.

Additionally, because this is a long-term relationship we will continue working with you to help navigate your [first 90 days](https://agileleanlife.com/the-first-90-days/) at work, your first performance review and more. 

#### Income Share Agreements

Instead of paying us an hourly rate, or a flat fee that doesn't incentivize us to get you the best job possible, we receive payment in the form of an income share agreement. An income share agreement is a contract between a recipient receiving either funds or services (such as yourself), and a provider delivering either funds or services. 

If you want to learn more about income share agreements, one of our career coaches wrote about their [typical terms](https://bradjohansen.com/texts/2019-09-15-introduction-to-income-share-agreements/) and [their benefits](https://bradjohansen.com/texts/2019-09-30-benefits-of-income-share-agreements/).

### How much does it cost?

**Nothing** up front. When you hire us as a career coach we will work for free until you get a job. Let me say that again. We do not get paid for anything until you get a job. Instead, you agree to share with us **1%** of your income for 12 months.

The more you make, the more we make.

Additionally, because this is a long-term relationship we will continue working with you to help navigate your [first 90 days](https://agileleanlife.com/the-first-90-days/) at work, your first performance review and more. 

#### Income Share Agreements

Instead of paying us an hourly rate, or a flat fee that doesn't incentivize us to get you the best job possible, we receive payment in the form of an income share agreement. An income share agreement is a contract between a recipient receiving either funds or services (such as yourself), and a provider delivering either funds or services. 

If you want to learn more about income share agreements, check out two posts one of our career coaches wrote about their [typical terms](https://bradjohansen.com/texts/2019-09-15-introduction-to-income-share-agreements/) and [their benefits](https://bradjohansen.com/texts/2019-09-30-benefits-of-income-share-agreements/).

### Introduction

In this post, I want to introduce the idea of income share agreements and define their basic features.

Fundamental to the idea of an income share agreement (ISAs) is that the amount of money you owe should be based on the amount of income you earn. In this way, ISAs differ from loans because they do not have a traditional interest rate. Instead, when a student receives funds as part of an ISA, they agree to repay the provider based on a percentage of their future income. 

Interest in ISAs has grown [immensely](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=income%20share%20agreements) in the last five years. Purdue University launched the [Back a Boiler](https://purdue.edu/backaboiler/) program in 2016 to provide ISAs to students as an alternative to private and Parent PLUS student loans. [Lambda School](http://lambdaschool.com), a coding school launched in 2016, eschews an up-front tuition in favor of ISAs. 

For the purpose of this post, I will refer to the receiver of the initial disbursement of funds as the "student," but that is not to suggest that the only use of income share agreements is for education funding. I will refer to the provider of the initial funds, and recipient of future income share payments, as the "investor". 

### Features of an Income Share Agreement

Income share agreements typically include the following elements: the funding amount, the payback rate, the income floor, the payment cap, and the term length.

#### Funding Amount

This is the amount of funds provided by the investor to the student at the creation of the ISA. The funds could be used for anything that might increase your future income: tuition payments, a living stipend, or a project. The funding amount is different than the principal in a traditional loan. In a traditional loan, the borrower must payback the lender the principal plus interest. In an ISA, there is no obligation to payback the initial funding amount.

Some ISAs will not include a funding amount. Instead, the investor provides services to the student and expects to be repaid in the future based on the students future income. At [Sharpest Minds](https://www.sharpestminds.com/)  mentors are connected with "students" and help them start a career in data science. The mentors are then paid back through an ISA.

#### Payback rate

The payback rate is the percentage of future income the student will owe the investor. The payback rate is analogous to the interest rate in a traditional loan. In a traditional loan, the minimum payment will based on either a fixed or variable interest rate applied to the principal. In an ISA, there is no principal amount. Instead, the monthly payment is based on applying the payback rate to their monthly income. [At Lambda School, the payback rate is 17%.](https://lambdaschool.com/faq#isa)

#### Term Length

The term length of an ISA is the length of time the student is obligated to make income-share payments. At Purdue, all Back a Boiler ISAs include a standard 10 year term. Some ISAs include provisions that allow the student to defer some of their payments. For example, at Purdue if the student attends graduate school or leaves the labor force (no longer seeking employment), their payment term will be extended.

#### Income Floor

Unlike loans, most income share agreements include a provision that restricts the student's obligation to make payments if their income falls below a certain level. For example, if the student attends Lambda School and earns less than $50,000 per year, they are not required to make any payments. At Purdue, the income floor is $20,000 per year. This is different than the deferment provisions discussed above. At Lambda School, if a student earned less than $50,000 for the entirety of the term length, they would have paid nothing to Lambda and have fully completed their payment obligations. However, if they left the labor market or went to graduate school they would not be obligated to make payments but would have their term extended.

#### Payment Cap

Another common feature of income share agreements is a payment cap, or maximum repayment obligation. At Lambda School, the payment cap is $30,000. This means that the sum of all income share payments will not exceed $30,000 and if the student reaches the cap, they will have completed their ISA's obligations. The purpose of this provision is to protect students who earn a much larger income than is expected. 

#### Other common provisions

##### Discharge provisions

Income share agreements will also include terms that decide how the agreement will be treated in bankruptcy.

##### Income verification

It is common for the method of income verification to be included in the contract as well. Today, students are typically required to submit a pay stub from their employer, link their primary bank account to the ISA service provider and submit their annual tax returns for reconciliation.

### The Benefits of Income Share Agreements

Income share agreements provide students with flexibility, financial stability, and information.

#### Incentives

The primary benefit of an income share agreement, in education financing, is that the incentives of the investor are aligned with that of the student. If the student earns a higher income, then the investor earns a higher return on their initial investment. In an ideal world, this would lead the investor, whether it be a pure investor-type, [mentor](http://sharpestminds.com), [university](http://purdue.edu/backaboiler), or [coding school](http://lambdaschool.com) to do everything possible to ensure the success of the student. Compared to the current state of education finance, this is a breath of fresh air. 

Today, most students take out loans in order to cover the costs of attending university. These costs can include tuition, fees, health insurance, room and board. The loans are provided by the federal government or a private lender, and they pay the university in full at the beginning of each semester. In this situation, what are the incentives as they relate to a student's future income? 

From the perspective of the university, there is no long-term, direct financial incentive - they have already been paid in full by the lenders. The university might still have some incentive to work for the student in the form of maintaining their public reputation, their accreditation and their national ranking, but it is weak. How much of that work contributes to an individual student's future income? It is not clear and we can't be sure that it is correlated at all with a student's income. The university has no direct incentive to care about the student's future income. What about the lender?

The lender does care to some extent about the student's future income, but only to the extent that it results in accurate, on-time payments for the term of the obligation. If you can make the loan payments, the lender does not care if you could make more money. Additionally, if a student falls under hard times and at some point fails to payback their loan obligation, it cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. 

With an income share agreement, the "lender" becomes an investor. They make more money as the student's income grows. A university or school reliant on returns from income share agreements for revenue would optimize their operations around income growth for their students. 

Because of these incentives, income share agreements are not priced purely on the students ability to pay but also include a prediction of what the students future income will be. This leads to what is known as price discovery, which has benefits for students and society.

#### Price Discovery

The incentive to accurately predict the student's future income leads to price discovery.  Think of the process of price discovery as a negotiation. In a negotiation, let's say over the selling price of a house, the seller might initially ask for $200,000. The buyer, who doesn't like the carpet and thinks the cabinets need to be replaced might initially bid $180,000. At this point there is no agreement and we have not "discovered" the true price of the house. But after some back and forth, and maybe some competing bids, the buyer and the seller finally agree to a selling price of $190,000. The market has "discovered" the price of the house. This price theoretically incorporates all the relevant factors: interest rates, expected inflation, future resale value and each participant's preferences, among others. To summarize, p[rice discovery](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricediscovery.asp) is the process by which two parties, in our case a student and an investor, agree on the price of an asset, or contract, and complete a transaction.

Similarly, the use of an income share agreement would follow a similar process. Pricing an income share agreement would require investors to accurately predict a student's future income. They might incorporate academic information such as school, major choice and GPA. Any information that might contain some predictive value could be incorporated into a model that attempts to predict future income. In a sophisticated market, there would be pricing differentiation among students with different characteristics. A chemical engineering major with a 4.0 GPA should be able to obtain a lower income-share rate than an English major with a 2.0 GPA, holding everything else equal, if it is expected that the chemical engineering major would earn a higher income on average. This is the case with [Purdue's Back a Boiler program](http://purdue.edu/backaboiler). At Purdue, the income share for a chemical engineering major is 3.04%, and for an English major it is 4.27%.

That's nice.[^1] But how is that a benefit? The benefit is that now student's can take advantage of the information being conveyed here. The "market" is telling the student that they will make more money if they are a chemical engineering major. They might have already known that, but the consequences of that fact may be difficult to understand. In the case of an income share agreement, the consequences are explicit.

#### Insurance

Income share agreements can also function as an insurance policy for the student. When their income decreases, the amount of income that they are required to pay also decreases. If a student falls on hard times, their payment obligations change to accommodate those hard times.  For example, if a student is injured and has to take unpaid leave from work to recover from their injury, they do not owe anything to the investor. Compared to traditional loans, this an improvement. While some loans have deferment clauses that will pause your payment obligation, they are usually  implemented when a student goes back to school. In other words, unless you decide to go to graduate school, you will always have to make payments on a traditional loan

Some private student loan providers, such as [Discover](https://www.discover.com/student-loans/repayment/finance/difference-between-deferment-forbearance), also have a "forbearance" provision that allows you to pause payments in the case of financial hardship, but it can only be used for a maximum of 12 months.

In all income share agreements, the student's payment obligation will adjust with their income level. In most, if not all, income share agreements payments can be deferred or forgiven if their income falls below a certain level ($50,000 at Lambda, or $20,000 at Purdue).

#### Conclusion

Income share agreements provide students with flexibility, financial stability, and information. They are more flexible than loans, because payments fluctuate with the student's ability to pay. This enhances their long-term financial stability, especially when combined with a strong income floor. Because of this flexibility, investors have an incentive to accurately predict a student's future income  in order to determine the price of a new income share agreement. This price convey's valuable information to the student about their earning potential, given their current choices, which may lead them to choose more prosperous careers.

##### Footnotes:

[^1]: Is it nice? [Some people](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/income-share-agreements) [do not think so](https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/income-share-agreements-arent-solution-student-debt/). They think that this price differentiation (or discrimination, depending on your perspective), leads students away from the true purpose of a university education. They also claim this could lead to discrimination that would run afoul of fair lending practices. For example, if white people make more money on average than black people, should that be factored into an ISA? I will address these concerns in a future post.
